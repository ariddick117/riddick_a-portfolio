# Alec Riddick: Portfolio Site

The portfolio site you develop this term is ultimately what you will use to present your work and your skillset (as designers and/or developers) to potential clients and employers. As such, the design and presentation of that design is up to you entirely, within the technical parameters listed below. Your final portfolio site will incorporate your logo and build upon the interface/branding designs you develop in Electronic Image and Production.

## Description

Within this website, you will learn about Alec Riddick and his skills as they relate to the field of web and graphic design. With eight pieces of work from his time at Fanshawe and Humber College, these pieces will serve as evidence for his work in the field of web design, graphic design, branding, package design, and advertising campaigns. The link to his Highlight Reel can be found in the Contact section and will showcase his abilities in 3D and Adobe After Effects.
