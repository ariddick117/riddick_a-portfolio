# Favourite Things: Alec Edition

Pick 3 things you love and create an app that showcases those things. Design a database that contains at least 5 columns - you must include an image of some kind and descriptive data about each of those things. Use the class file as a reference - however DO NOT use the design files - make something better.

## Description

Design a mobile-first one page web application that highlights your favourite things. Use images, video, 3D - anything at all. You must have a database with at least 5 columns - you MUST have title / heading (text), image(s) and descriptive text. The last two columns
are your choice. Include a landing / splash page and a dynamic route to showcase each of your favourite things. You should have at least three views, one of which should be an error.hbs page. Use at least 2 routes. One of these routes MUST be dynamic with a route parameter.
Use modern tools and techniques to generate the required assets. Use a Github repo; use Express to generate the application and the mysql package to connect to a database. Retrieve data using route parameters, and render the appropriate view with the query
response as the data resource. Use SASS and the usual build tools (Gulp, NPM) for automation / compiling finished web-ready assets.
You can continue to use Handlebars as your templating engine, or explore another system like EJS or Pug.
